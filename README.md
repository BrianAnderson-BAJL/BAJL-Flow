# FlowEngine
This project is a work in progress. The engine works, but can't really do anything yet. The only step that works is Flow.Sleeep, which was my testing step.
## About
Flow Engine backend business logic controller.
## Future features
Many of the below features are fleshed out in the code, but they are far from complete
* Users
* Security profiles
* Upload flows to server and have them update / added in real time, no reboot required
* Breakpoints
* Trace log
* Jump points (a way to link to other areas of a flow)
* Comments
* Compile flows, check flows for errors (double links from output to same input, missing connections)
* Layouts, save, load
